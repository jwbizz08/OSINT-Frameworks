Objective: Collect, analyze, and track cyber threats, attack indicators, and threat actors, focusing on malware, vulnerabilities, infrastructure, and threat actor behavior.

Step 1: Identify the Target and Scope of Investigation

Before starting the investigation, it's critical to define what you're investigating (e.g., a specific organization, hacker group, vulnerability, or incident). This will guide your data collection and analysis.

Google Search: Begin with a general search to find any available information about the target.

Google SearchShodan: Search for internet-facing devices, servers, and infrastructures that belong to the target or are related to the threat.

WHOIS Lookup: Investigate domain registrations to see who owns or controls the target's domain or infrastructure.

Censys: Search for exposed devices or servers with security issues related to the target.

VirusTotal: Check if any associated domain, IP, or file hash has been flagged for malicious behavior or known exploits.

Step 2: Gather Domain and IP Address Information

Passive DNS Lookup: Use passive DNS services to gather historical domain information, resolve IP addresses, and identify previous associations with other entities.

IPinfo.io: Look up IP addresses linked to the target to analyze geolocation, ISP, and ownership details.

DomainTools: Find historical data and domain registrations associated with the target organization.

Google Dorking: Use advanced search operators to uncover specific IP addresses, vulnerable servers, or documents related to the target.

Step 3: Identify and Analyze Malware Indicators

If the investigation centers around malware or cyber-attacks, identifying malicious software and analyzing it is key to understanding the threat.

VirusTotal: Search for malware hashes (e.g., MD5, SHA256) or URLs that have been flagged as malicious.

Hybrid Analysis: Analyze submitted malware files to see their behavior and associated indicators of compromise (IoCs).

MalwareBazaar: Search for malware samples or track emerging malware trends.

Any.run: Use sandbox environments to analyze suspicious files in a controlled, isolated environment.

Step 4: Investigate Vulnerabilities and Exploits

Understanding vulnerabilities in systems or software is crucial for identifying potential targets of exploitation by threat actors.

Exploit-DB: Search for known vulnerabilities and exploits that are publicly available and could be used by cybercriminals.

CVE Details: Look for CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) that are tied to the targetâ€™s systems, software, or hardware.

Shodan: Search for specific vulnerabilities in publicly exposed devices or servers that may be vulnerable to exploitation.

OpenVAS: Use open-source vulnerability scanners to identify weaknesses in the target's infrastructure.

Step 5: Track Threat Actor Behavior

Identify and track the activities, tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of cyber threat actors.

Twitter & Telegram: Monitor for discussions or posts made by threat actors. Look for suspicious accounts or groups.

Pastebin: Search for paste dumps that may contain data stolen by threat actors or communication about cybercrimes.

Dark Web Search Engines (Ahmia, DarkSearch): Monitor the dark web for stolen data, ransom notes, or other indicators of cybercriminal activity.

Hacker Forums (RaidForums, XSS): Look for communications from hacker groups, tool releases, or leaks.

GitHub & GitLab: Monitor repositories for code or tools used by threat actors, such as malware, exploit kits, or hacking tools.

Step 6: Monitor and Track Attack Campaigns

Keep track of ongoing cyberattack campaigns, including the techniques and tools used by attackers, the targeted industries, and any publicly available reports.

Threat Intelligence Platforms (Anomali, ThreatCrowd): Use platforms that aggregate information about known cyber threats, attack indicators, and malicious activity.

MISP (Malware Information Sharing Platform): Share and receive indicators of compromise (IoCs) and threat intelligence related to cyber attacks.

FireEye Threat Intelligence: Check for reports detailing specific cyber-attacks and the actors involved, their methods, and targeted organizations.

AlienVault (AT&T Cybersecurity): Collect information from open-source threat intelligence to enhance your analysis of cyber threats.

Step 7: Investigate the Dark Web & Underground Marketplaces

Examine underground markets, hacker communities, and forums that could be associated with cybercrime activity.

Dark Web Search Engines (Ahmia, DarkSearch): Search dark web sites for stolen data, black market transactions, or information about cybercrime tools and services.

Hacker Forums: Look for forums where cybercriminals discuss tactics, tools, and targets.

Step 8: Analyze Digital Forensics and Incident Response Data

For investigations involving cyber attacks or breaches, digital forensics will help identify the origin, method, and impact of an attack.

FTK Imager: Use this for forensic data collection and analysis, including recovering files and examining metadata from compromised systems.

Autopsy: Use this for detailed investigation and analysis of computer systems, including file activity and user behavior.

Volatility: Analyze memory dumps from systems involved in cyber incidents to identify malware or malicious activity.

Step 9: Continuous Monitoring & Alerting

Set up ongoing monitoring and alert systems to track emerging threats and activities continuously.

OpenDXL (McAfee): Use this for real-time monitoring, reporting, and alerting for potential cybersecurity incidents.

OSINT Tools (Social Media Monitoring): Continuously track social media, news, and other sources for indicators of emerging cyber threats.


Step 10: Reporting & Actionable Intelligence

Analyze the data gathered from these sources and create a comprehensive report on the findings. This report should include identified vulnerabilities, threats, IoCs, and recommended actions.

Maltego: Use for visualizing and reporting your findings in an easily understandable way. It helps in understanding relationships and linkages.

Sigma Rules: Use Sigma's rules for structured reporting of cyber incidents and relevant indicators.
